## FAQ
Catalog X is not working?
- Some catalogs (listen notes) are using a paid API to retrieve podcasts info. This means that it will stop working whenever a certain amount of requests is reached, unless paid for. This addon is a community effort and I do not plan to pay for additional costs. You can send me an email if you wish to donate some money.

I found a bug
- Squash it, fork it or [open an issue](https://github.com/sleeyax/stremio-podcasts-addon/issues/new)!

## Running locally
First of all make sure you have a recent version of nodejs (https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then clone this repo and run:
```
npm install
```
Now copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the following lines:
```
LISTEN_NOTES_API_KEY=xxx
```
Replace 'xxx' with your [listen notes API](https://www.listennotes.com/api/) key.

Now you have to generate the required cache files by running `npm run cache:generate`. Don't forget this step if you want the listen notes catalog to work!

Finally, to start a development server that watches for file changes run `npm run start:watch`. In production you should be using `npm run start`.
